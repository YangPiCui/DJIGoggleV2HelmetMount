# Ergonomic Vertical Keyboard (EVK)

## Introduction
Do you get a sore neck and stiff fingers from typing? Have you developed a stretched forth neck and a hump back?  
The keyboard and the mouse are the culprits. They force our hands to lay flat on the desk pronated. This in turn stresses our neck.  
Now put your hands on the desk but rotate your palms to face each other. Do you start to feel your shoulders relaxed, your neck relieved, and your back straightened?    
The Ergonomic Vertical Keyboard (EVK) lets you do exactly that.
- The case orientates the key caps into a vertical formation, so that palms face each other while typing.

- Concave design accomodate fingers' natural paths. [[Kinesis Advantage 2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/)  | [British patent 1,016,993](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=63415)]  
- Compact design to save desk space for the mouse.
- An efficient, customizable keymap layout. Little fingers' extra columns have been reassigned to other fingers to alleviate sore pinkies.

I testify that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. You should read it, repent and be baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for a remission of your sins.

I have included all necessary build instructions for each EVK version. It takes one about a week to build an EVK.
